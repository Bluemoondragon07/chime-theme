# üîî Chime

![](Screenshots/Showcase.png)

Chime was designed with a special intention to not overwhelm you with options. Built on the principle of highly customizable simplicity, **Chime** provides vast personalization options without going past only what's most important.

# ‚≠ê Features (Style Settings plug-in)
- 12 different **color schemes**
- Two different **layout styles.**
- Hide certain buttons and enable full-screen **Focus Mode**
- Special style settings for the **page-gallery plug-in**
- Options for styling **blockquotes, headings, checkboxes, links,** and *more*.  

# üîñ CSS Classes
Chime includes four css classes that may come in handy to some people. 
### Wiki-page Class
Format your note like a wiki page. This class floats images and info blockquotes to the right and formats headings and text. To use, type `cssClasses: wiki-page` in a note's frontmatter.

## Novel Class
Format your note like a page in a book. This class changes the font, indentation, and paragraph spacing. Pressing enter once creates a normal paragraph without an indent (great if you don't like indented dialogue), while pressing enter twice, like you would usually create a paragraph in Obsidian, creates an indented paragraph. Both paragraphs are evenly spaced in preview mode. 
To use, type `Cssclasses: novel` in the frontmatter of a note.

## Wide Class
Sometimes I wish Obsidian was more like Notion and allowed me to make certain pages automatically wider without messing with settings--Which is why I made this CSS class. This will make a note wide even when Readable Line Length is turned on. To use, type `Cssclasses: wide` in the frontmatter.

## Cards Class (by kepano)
The spectacular cards CSS class was originally created for the Minimal Theme by kepano.

This class will make items in dataview tables show up in a card-like grid. To use, type `cssClasses: cards` in the frontmatter. This class requires the **dataview** plug-in.

# üîå Compatible Plug-Ins
## Dataview
**Chime** includes styling for inline metadata and dataview tables. The `cards` class also utilizes this plug-in.

## Pages Gallery
Chime makes minor changes to the **Pages Gallery** plug-in and gives it an appearance similar to that of the cards css class. Text will now break and continue on a new line rather than overflowing when *responsive height* is enabled, and the tiles will be resized according to amount of text with the *loose tiles* setting. Images will be automatically set to *cover* and will override *contain* (this may change later, I just couldn't get the images to force certain ratios in contain mode). The font size within the tiles has been adjusted and a style setting has been added to get rid of the searchbar.
