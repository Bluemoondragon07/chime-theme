## ‚úÖ Simplicity
Chime was designed with a special intention to not overwhelm you with options. Customizability is given for only the most important components.
## üö© CSS Classes
Chime includes four css classes that may come in handy to some people.
### Wiki-page Class
Format your note like a wiki page. To use, type `cssClasses: wiki-page` in a note's frontmatter.

### Novel Class
Format your note like a page in a book. This class changes the font, indentation, and paragraph spacing. 
To use, type `Cssclasses: novel` in the frontmatter of a note.

### Wide Class
Sometimes I wish Obsidian was more like Notion and allowed me to make certain pages wider--Which is why I made this CSS class. This will make a note wide even when Readable Line Length is turned on. To use, type `Cssclasses: wide` in the frontmatter.
### Cards Class (by kepano)
The spectacular cards CSS class was originally created for the Minimal Theme by kepano.

This class will make items in dataview tables show up in a card-like grid. To use, type `cssClasses: cards` in the frontmatter.
